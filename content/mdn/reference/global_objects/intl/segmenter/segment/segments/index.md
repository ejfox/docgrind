A **`Segments`** object is an iterable collection of the segments of a text string. It is returned by a call to the [`segment()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter/segment) method of an [`Intl.Segmenter`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter) object.

## Instance methods

- [`Segments.prototype.containing()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter/segment/Segments/containing)
  - : Returns an object describing the segment in the original string that includes the code unit at a specified index.
- [`Segments.prototype[Symbol.iterator]()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Segmenter/segment/Segments/Symbol.iterator)
  - : Returns an iterator to iterate over the segments.
